inverter and reads out the status.html page, which contains all necessary information 
from the inverter.

## Installation

Download the script, adjust the variables (see comment SETTINGS) and execute it on a 
local computer or server. 

> It is important that the inverter is connected to the same network.

## Execute

php -f deye.php
```
